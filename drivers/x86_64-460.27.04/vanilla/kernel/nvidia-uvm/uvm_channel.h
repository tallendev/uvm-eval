// UVM channels

// A channel manager is created as part of the GPU addition. This involves
// creating channels for each of the supported types (uvm_channel_type_t) in
// separate channel pools possibly using different CE instances in the HW. Each
// channel has a uvm_gpu_tracking_semaphore_t and a set of uvm_gpfifo_entry_t
// (one per each HW GPFIFO entry) allowing to track completion of pushes on the
// channel.
//
// Beginning a push on a channel implies reserving a GPFIFO entry in that
// channel and hence there can only be as many on-going pushes per channel as
// there are free GPFIFO entries. This ensures that ending a push won't have to
// wait for a GPFIFO entry to free up.
