<h3>Installation and configuration</h3>
<p>Installation and configuration of the NVIDIA Linux Driver Set on
a notebook is the same as for any desktop environment, with a few
additions, as described below.</p>
<h3>Power Management</h3>
<p>All notebook NVIDIA GPUs support power management, both S3 (also
known as "Standby" or "Suspend to RAM") and S4 (also known as
"Hibernate", "Suspend to Disk" or "SWSUSP"). Power management is
system-specific and is dependent upon all the components in the
system; some systems may be more problematic than other
systems.</p>
<p>Most recent notebook NVIDIA GPUs also support PowerMizer, which
monitors application work load to adjust system parameters to
deliver the optimal balance of performance and battery life.
However, PowerMizer is only enabled by default on some notebooks.
Please see the known issues below for more details.</p>
<h3>Hotkey Switching of Display Devices</h3>
<p>Most laptops generate keyboard events when the display change
hotkey is pressed. On some laptops, these are simply normal
keyboard keys. On others, they generate ACPI events that may be
translated into keyboard events by other system components.</p>
<p>The NVIDIA driver does not handle ACPI display change hotkeys
itself. Instead, it is expected for desktop environments to listen
for these key-press events and respond by reconfiguring the display
devices as necessary.</p>
<h3>Docking Events</h3>
<p>All notebook NVIDIA GPUs support docking, however support may be
limited by the OS or system. There are three types of notebook
docking (hot, warm, and cold), which refer to the state of the
system when the docking event occurs. hot refers to a powered on
system with a live desktop, warm refers to a system that has
entered a suspended power management state, and cold refers to a
system that has been powered off. Only warm and cold docking are
supported by the NVIDIA driver.</p>
<h3>Known Notebook Issues</h3>
<p>There are a few known issues associated with notebooks:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>In many cases, suspending and/or resuming will fail. As
mentioned above, this functionality is very system-specific. There
are still many cases that are problematic. Here are some tips that
may help:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">

<li>
<p>In some cases, hibernation can have bad interactions with the
PCI Express bus clocks, which can lead to system hangs when
entering hibernation. This issue is still being investigated, but a
known workaround is to leave an OpenGL application running when
hibernating.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On notebooks with relatively little system memory, repetitive
hibernation attempts may fail due to insufficient free memory. This
problem can be avoided by running `echo 0 &gt;
/sys/power/image_size`, which reduces the image size to be stored
during hibernation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some distributions use a tool called vbetool to save and restore
VGA adapter state. This tool is incompatible with NVIDIA GPUs'
Video BIOSes and is likely to lead to problems restoring the GPU
and its state. Disabling calls to this tool in your distribution's
init scripts may improve power management reliability.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On some notebooks, PowerMizer is not enabled by default. This
issue is being investigated, and there is no known workaround.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When available, the NVIDIA driver installs a backlight handler
that allows access to the driver's backlight controller through
/sys/class/backlight/nvidia_0. This option can be disabled by
passing the</p>
<pre class="screen">
NVreg_EnableBacklightHandler=0
</pre>
<p>parameter to the nvidia kernel module.</p>
