<p>This chapter provides instructions for installing the NVIDIA
driver. Note that after installation, but prior to using the
driver, you must complete the steps described in <a href=

<p>Before you begin the installation, exit the X server and
terminate all OpenGL applications (note that it is possible that
some OpenGL applications persist even after the X server has
stopped). You should also set the default run level on your system
such that it will boot to a VGA console, and not directly to X.
Doing so will make it easier to recover if there is a problem
during the installation process. See <a href="newusertips.html"

Kernel Interface</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The NVIDIA kernel module has a kernel interface layer that must
be compiled specifically for each kernel. NVIDIA distributes the
source code to this kernel interface layer.</p>
<p>When the installer is run, it will check your system for the
required kernel sources and compile the kernel interface. You must
have the source code for your kernel installed for compilation to
work. On most systems, this means that you will need to locate and
install the correct kernel-source, kernel-headers, or kernel-devel
package; on some distributions, no additional packages are
required.</p>
<p>After the correct kernel interface has been compiled, the kernel
interface will be linked with the closed-source portion of the
NVIDIA kernel module. This requires that you have a linker
installed on your system. The linker, usually <code class=
"filename">/usr/bin/ld</code>, is part of the binutils package. You
must have a linker installed prior to installing the NVIDIA
driver.</p>

<h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name=
"RegisteringTheNda02d" id="RegisteringTheNda02d"></a>Registering
the NVIDIA Kernel Module with DKMS</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The installer will check for the presence of DKMS on your
system. If DKMS is found, you will be given the option of
registering the kernel module with DKMS, and using the DKMS
infrastructure to build and install the kernel module. On most
systems with DKMS, DKMS will take care of automatically rebuilding
registered kernel modules when installing a different Linux
kernel.</p>
<p>If <code class="filename">nvidia-installer</code> is unable to
install the kernel module through DKMS, the installation will be
aborted and no kernel module will be installed. If this happens,
installation should be attempted again, without the DKMS
option.</p>
<p>Note that versions of <code class=
"filename">nvidia-installer</code> shipped with drivers before
release 304 do not interact with DKMS. If you choose to register
the NVIDIA kernel module with DKMS, please ensure that the module
is removed from the DKMS database before using a non-DKMS aware
version of <code class="filename">nvidia-installer</code> to
install an older driver; otherwise, module source files may be
deleted without first unregistering the module, potentially leaving
the DKMS database in an inconsistent state. Running <code class=
"filename">nvidia-uninstall</code> before installing a driver using
an older installer will invoke the correct <strong class=
"userinput"><code>dkms remove</code></strong> command to clean up
the installation.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of secure storage for private keys that can be
utilized by automated processes such as DKMS, it is not possible to
use DKMS in conjunction with the module signing support built into
<code class="filename">nvidia-installer</code>.</p>

<h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="modulesigning" id=
"modulesigning"></a>Signing the NVIDIA Kernel Module</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Some kernels may require that kernel modules be
cryptographically signed by a key trusted by the kernel in order to
be loaded. In particular, many distributions require modules to be
signed when loaded into kernels running on UEFI systems with Secure
Boot enabled. <code class="filename">nvidia-installer</code>
includes support for signing the kernel module before installation,
to ensure that it can be loaded on such systems. Note that not all
UEFI systems have Secure Boot enabled, and not all kernels running
on UEFI Secure Boot systems will require signed kernel modules, so
if you are uncertain about whether your system requires signed
kernel modules, you may try installing the driver without signing
the kernel module, to see if the unsigned kernel module can be
loaded.</p>
<p>In order to sign the kernel module, you will need a private
signing key, and an X.509 certificate for the corresponding public
key. The X.509 certificate must be trusted by the kernel before the
module can be loaded: we recommend ensuring that the signing key be
trusted before beginning the driver installation, so that the newly
signed module can be used immediately. If you do not already have a
key pair suitable for module signing use, you must generate one.
Please consult your distribution's documentation for details on the
types of keys suitable for module signing, and how to generate
them. <code class="filename">nvidia-installer</code> can generate a
key pair for you at install time, but it is preferable to have a
key pair already generated and trusted by the kernel before
installation begins.</p>
<p>Once you have a key pair ready, you can use that key pair in
<code class="filename">nvidia-installer</code> by passing the keys
to the installer on the command line with the <code class=
"option">--module-signing-secret-key</code> and <code class=
"option">--module-signing-public-key</code> options. As an example,
it is possible to install the driver with a signed kernel module in
silent mode (i.e., non-interactively) by running:</p>
<pre class="screen">
 # sh ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-460.27.04.run -s \
--module-signing-secret-key=/path/to/signing.key \
--module-signing-public-key=/path/to/signing.x509
</pre>
<p>In the example above, <code class="filename">signing.key</code>
and <code class="filename">signing.x509</code> are a private/public
key pair, and the public key is already enrolled in one of the
kernel's trusted module signing key sources.</p>
<p>On UEFI systems with secure boot enabled, nvidia-installer will
present a series of interactive prompts to guide users through the
module signing process. As an alternative to setting the key paths
on the command line, the paths can be provided interactively in
response to the prompts. These prompts will also appear when
building the NVIDIA kernel module against a kernel which has
CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_FORCE enabled in its configuration, or if the
installer is run in expert mode.</p>
<h3>Key Sources Trusted by the Kernel</h3>
<p>In order to load a kernel module into a kernel that requires
module signatures, the module must be signed by a key that the
kernel trusts. There are several sources that a kernel may draw
upon to build its pool of trusted keys. If you have generated a key
pair, but it is not yet trusted by your kernel, you must add a
certificate for your public key to a trusted key source before it
can be used to verify signatures of signed kernel modules. These
trusted sources include:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl>
<dt><span class="term">Certificates embedded into the kernel
image</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>On kernels with <code class="option">CONFIG_MODULE_SIG</code>
set, a certificate for the public key used to sign the in-tree
kernel modules is embedded, along with any additional module
signing certificates provided at build time, into the kernel image.
Modules signed by the private keys that correspond to the embedded
public key certificates will be trusted by the kernel.</p>
<p>Since the keys are embedded at build time, the only way to add a
new public key is to build a new kernel. On UEFI systems with
Secure Boot enabled, the kernel image will, in turn, need to be
signed by a key that is trusted by the bootloader, so users
building their own kernels with custom embedded keys should have a
plan for making sure that the bootloader will load the new
kernel.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term">Certificates stored in the UEFI firmware
database</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>On kernels with <code class=
"option">CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_UEFI</code>, in addition to any
certificates embedded into the kernel image, the kernel can use
certificates stored in the <code class="filename">db</code>,
<code class="filename">KEK</code>, or <code class=
"filename">PK</code> databases of the computer's UEFI firmware to
verify the signatures of kernel modules, as long as they are not in
the UEFI <code class="filename">dbx</code> blacklist.</p>
<p>Any user who holds the private key for the Secure Boot
<code class="filename">PK</code>, or any of the keys in the
<code class="filename">KEK</code> list should be able to add new
keys that can be used by a kernel with <code class=
"option">CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_UEFI</code>, and any user with physical
access to the computer should be able to delete any existing Secure
Boot keys, and install his or her own keys instead. Please consult
the documentation for your UEFI-based computer system for details
on how to manage the UEFI Secure Boot keys.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term">Certificates stored in a supplementary key
database</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Some distributions include utilities that allow for the secure
storage and management of cryptographic keys in a database that is
separate from the kernel's built-in key list, and the key lists in
the UEFI firmware. A prominent example is the MOK (Machine Owner
Key) database used by some versions of the <code class=
"filename">shim</code> bootloader, and the associated management
utilities, <code class="filename">mokutil</code> and <code class=
"filename">MokManager</code>.</p>
<p>Such a system allows users to enroll additional keys without the
need to build a new kernel or manage the UEFI Secure Boot keys.
Please consult your distribution's documentation for details on
whether such a supplementary key database is available, and if so,
how to manage its keys.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p></p>
<h3>Generating Signing Keys in nvidia-installer</h3>
<p><code class="filename">nvidia-installer</code> can generate keys
that can be used for module signing, if existing keys are not
readily available. Note that a module signed by a newly generated
key cannot be loaded into a kernel that requires signed modules
until its key is trusted, and when such a module is installed on
such a system, the installed driver will not be immediately usable,
even if the installation was successful.</p>
<p>When <code class="filename">nvidia-installer</code> generates a
key pair and uses it to sign a kernel module, an X.509 certificate
containing the public key will be installed to disk, so that it can
be added to one of the kernel's trusted key sources. <code class=
"filename">nvidia-installer</code> will report the location of the
installed certificate: make a note of this location, and of the
certificate's SHA1 fingerprint, so that you will be able to enroll
the certificate and verify that it is correct, after the
installation is finished.</p>
<p>By default, <code class="filename">nvidia-installer</code> will
attempt to securely delete the generated private key with
<code class="filename">shred -u</code> after the module is signed.
This is to prevent the key from being exploited to sign a malicious
kernel module, but it also means that the same key can't be used
again to install a different driver, or even to install the same
driver on a different kernel. <code class=
"filename">nvidia-installer</code> can optionally install the
private signing key to disk, as it does with the public
certificate, so that the key pair can be reused in the future.</p>
<p>If you elect to install the private key, please make sure that
appropriate precautions are taken to ensure that it cannot be
stolen. Some examples of precautions you may wish to take:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl>
<dt><span class="term">Prevent the key from being read by anybody
without physical access to the computer</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>In general, physical access is required to install Secure Boot
keys, including keys managed outside of the standard UEFI key
databases, to prevent attackers who have remotely compromised the
security of the operating system from installing malicious boot
code. If a trusted key is available to remote users, even root,
then it will be possible for an attacker to sign arbitrary kernel
modules without first having physical access, making the system
less secure.</p>
<p>One way to ensure that the key is not available to remote users
is to keep it on a removable storage medium, which is disconnected
from the computer except when signing modules.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term">Do not store the unencrypted private
key</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>Encrypting the private key can add an extra layer of security:
the key will not be useful for signing modules unless it can be
successfully decrypted, first. Make sure not to store unencrypted
copies of the key on persistent storage: either use volatile
storage (e.g. a RAM disk), or securely delete any unencrypted
copies of the key when not in use (e.g. using <code class=
"filename">shred</code> instead of <code class=
"filename">rm</code>). Note that using <code class=
"filename">shred</code> may not be sufficient to fully purge data
from some storage devices, in particular, some types of solid state
storage.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p></p>
<h3>Alternatives to the Installer's Module Signing Support</h3>
<p>It is possible to load the NVIDIA kernel module on a system that
requires signed modules, without using the installer's module
signing support. Depending on your particular use case, you may
find one of these alternatives more suitable than signing the
module with <code class="filename">nvidia-installer</code>:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl>
<dt><span class="term">Disable UEFI Secure Boot, if
applicable</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>On some kernels, a requirement for signed modules is only
enforced when booted on a UEFI system with Secure Boot enabled.
Some users of such kernels may find it more convenient to disable
Secure Boot; however, note that this will reduce the security of
your system by making it easier for malicious users to install
potentially harmful boot code, kernels, or kernel modules.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term">Use a kernel that doesn't require signed
modules</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>The kernel can be configured not to check module signatures, or
to check module signatures, but allow modules without a trusted
signature to be loaded, anyway. Installing a kernel configured in
such a way will allow the installation of unsigned modules. Note
that on Secure Boot systems, you will still need to ensure that the
kernel be signed with a key trusted by the bootloader and/or boot
firmware, and that a kernel that doesn't enforce module signature
verification may be slightly less secure than one that does.</p>

<h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name=
"AddingPrecompil0c783" id="AddingPrecompil0c783"></a>Adding
Precompiled Kernel Interfaces to the Installer Package</h2>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>When <code class="filename">nvidia-installer</code> runs, it
searches for a pre-compiled kernel interface layer for the target
kernel: if one is found, then the complete kernel module can be
produced by linking the precompiled interface with <code class=
"filename">nv-kernel.o</code>, instead of needing to compile the
kernel interface on the target system. <code class=
"filename">nvidia-installer</code> includes a feature which allows
users to add a precompiled interface to the installer package. This
is useful in many use cases; for example, an administrator of a
large group of similarly configured computers can prepare an
installer package with a precompiled interface for the kernel
running on those computers, then deploy the customized installer,
which will be able to install the NVIDIA kernel module without
needing to have the kernel development headers or a compiler
installed on the target systems. (A linker is still required.)</p>
<p>To use this feature, simply invoke the <code class=
"filename">.run</code> installer package with the <code class=
"option">--add-this-kernel</code> option; e.g.</p>
<pre class="screen">
 # sh ./NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-460.27.04.run --add-this-kernel
</pre>
<p>This will unpack <code class=
"filename">NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-460.27.04.run</code>, compile a
kernel interface layer for the currently running kernel (use the
<code class="option">--kernel-source-path</code> and <code class=
"option">--kernel-output-path</code> options to specify a target
kernel other than the currently running one), and create a new
installer package with the kernel interface layer added.</p>
<p>Administrators of large groups of similarly configured computers
that are configured to require trusted signatures in order to load
kernel modules may find this feature especially useful when
combined with the built-in support for module signing in
<code class="filename">nvidia-installer</code>. To package a .run
file with a precompiled kernel interface layer, plus a detached
module signature for the linked module, just use the <code class=
"option">--module-signing-secret-key</code> and <code class=
"option">--module-signing-public-key</code> options alongside the
<code class="option">--add-this-kernel</code> option. The resulting
package, besides being installable without kernel headers or a
compiler on the target system, has the added benefit of being able
to produce a signed module without needing access to the private
key on the install target system. Note that the detached signature
will only be valid if the result of linking the precompiled
interface with <code class="filename">nv-kernel.o</code> on the
target system is exactly the same as the result of linking those
two files on the system that was used to create the custom
installer. To ensure optimal compatibility, the linker used on both
the package preparation system and the install target system should
be the same.</p>
