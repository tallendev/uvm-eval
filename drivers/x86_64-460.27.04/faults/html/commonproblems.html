<p>There are two cases where this may occur. If the displays are

<p>The kernel interface layer of the NVIDIA kernel module must be

to reinstall the driver.</p>
<p>ADVANCED: You can install the NVIDIA kernel module for a non

and installed a new kernel, but have not rebooted yet) with a
command line such as this:</p>

attempts to load the NVIDIA kernel module before installing the
driver, and will abort if this test load fails. Similarly, if the
kernel module fails to load when starting the an X server with the
NVIDIA X driver, the X server will fail to start.</p>
<p>If the NVIDIA kernel module fails to load, you should check the
output of <strong class="userinput"><code>dmesg</code></strong> for
kernel error messages and/or attempt to load the kernel module
explicitly with <strong class="userinput"><code>modprobe
nvidia</code></strong>. There are a number of common failure
cases:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>Some symbols that the kernel module depends on failed to be
resolved. If this happens, then the kernel module was most likely
built against a Linux kernel source tree (or kernel headers) for a
kernel revision or configuration that doesn't match the running
kernel.</p>
<p>In some cases, the NVIDIA kernel module may fail to resolve
symbols due to those symbols being provided by modules that were
built as part of the configuration of the currently running kernel,
but which are not installed. For example, some distributions, such
as Ubuntu 14.04, provide the DRM kernel module in an optionally
installed package (in the case of Ubuntu 14.04, linux-image-extra),
but the kernel headers will reflect the availability of DRM
regardless of whether the module that provides it is actually
installed. The NVIDIA kernel module build will detect the
availability of DRM when building, but will fail at load time with
messages such as:</p>
<pre class="screen">
nvidia: Unknown symbol drm_open (err 0)
</pre>
<p></p>
<p>If any of the NVIDIA kernel modules fail to load due to
unresolved symbols, and you are certain that the modules were built
against the correct kernel source tree (or headers), check to see
if there are any optionally installable modules that might provide
these symbols which are not currently installed. If you believe
that you might not be using the correct kernel sources/headers, you
can specify their location when you install the NVIDIA driver using
the <code class="option">--kernel-source-path</code> command line
option (see <strong class="userinput"><code>sh
NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64-460.27.04.run
--advanced-options</code></strong> for details).</p>

&ldquo;Interaction with the Nouveau Driver&rdquo;</a> for more
information on Nouveau and how to disable it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The kernel requires that kernel modules carry a valid signature
from a trusted key, and the NVIDIA kernel module is unsigned, or
has an invalid or untrusted signature. This may happen, for
example, on some systems with UEFI Secure Boot enabled. See
<a href="installdriver.html#modulesigning" title=
"Signing the NVIDIA Kernel Module">the section called
&ldquo;Signing the NVIDIA Kernel Module&rdquo;</a> for more
information about signing the kernel module.</p>

<li>
<p>No supported GPU is detected, either because no NVIDIA GPUs are
detected in the system, or because none of the NVIDIA GPUs which
are present are supported by this version of the NVIDIA kernel
module. See <a href="supportedchips.html" title=

<p>These problems are generally caused by the build using the wrong
kernel header files (i.e. header files for a different kernel
version than the one you are running). The convention used to be
that kernel header files should be stored in <code class=
"filename">/usr/include/linux/</code>, but that is deprecated in
favor of <code class=
"filename">/lib/modules/RELEASE/build/include</code> (where RELEASE
is the result of <span><strong class="command">uname

"filename">nvidia-installer</code> should be able to determine the
location on your system; however, if you encounter a problem you
can force the build to use certain header files by using the
<code class="option">--kernel-include-dir</code> option. For this
to work you will of course need the appropriate kernel header files
installed on your system. Consult the documentation that came with
your distribution; some distributions do not install the kernel
header files by default, or they install headers that do not
coincide properly with the kernel you are running.</p>

<p>Installation or configuration problems may prevent the X server,
a login/session manager, or a desktop environment from starting
correctly. If your system is failing to display a login screen, or
failing to start a desktop session, try the following
troubleshooting steps:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>Make sure that you are using the correct X driver for your
configuration. Recent X servers will be able to automatically
select the correct X driver in many cases, but if your X server
does not automatically select the correct driver, you may need to
manually configure it. For example, systems with multiple GPUs will
likely require a PCI BusID in the "Device" section of the X
configuration file, in order to specify which GPU is to be
used.</p>
<p>If you are planning to use NVIDIA GPUs for graphics, you can run
the <code class="filename">nvidia-xconfig</code> utility to
automatically generate a simple X configuration file that uses the
NVIDIA X driver. If you are not using NVIDIA GPUs for graphics
(e.g. on a server system where displays are driven by an onboard
graphics controller, and NVIDIA GPUs are used for non-graphical
computational purposes only), <span class="emphasis"><em>do
not</em></span> run <code class=
"filename">nvidia-xconfig</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some recent desktop environments (e.g. GNOME 3, Unity), window
managers (e.g. mutter, compiz), and session managers (e.g. gdm3)
require a working OpenGL driver in order to function correctly. In
addition to making sure that the X server is configured to use the
correct X driver for your configuration, please ensure that you are
using the correct OpenGL driver to match your X driver.</p>
<p>If you are not using NVIDIA GPUs for graphical purposes, try
installing the driver with the <code class=
"option">--no-opengl-files</code> option on the installer's command
line to prevent the installer from overwriting any existing OpenGL
installation, which may be needed for proper OpenGL functionality
on whichever graphics controller is to be used on the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some desktop environments (e.g. GNOME 3, Unity) and window
managers (e.g. mutter) do not properly support multiple X screens,
leaving you with a blank screen displaying only a cursor on the
non-primary X screen. If you encounter such a problem, try
configuring X with a single X screen, or switching to a different
desktop environment or window manager.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Desktop environments, window managers, and session managers that
require OpenGL typically also require the X Composite extension. If
you have disabled the Composite extension, either explicitly, or by
enabling a feature that is not compatible with it, try re-enabling
the extension (possibly by disabling any incompatible features). If
you are unable to satisfy your desired use case with the Composite
extension enabled, try switching to a different desktop
environment, window manager, and/or session manager that does not
require Composite.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check the X log (e.g. <code class=
"filename">/var/log/Xorg.0.log</code>) for additional errors not
covered above. Warning or error messages in the log may highlight a
specific problem that can be fixed with a configuration
adjustment.</p>

be loaded by default when starting a new X session. To load
settings from <code class="filename">~/.nvidia-settings-rc</code>
without actually opening the <span><strong class=

command line. <span><strong class="command">nvidia-settings

<p>Even after <span><strong class=

any settings set in <code class=
"filename">~/.nvidia-settings-rc</code>, some desktop environments
(e.g. GNOME, KDE, Unity, Xfce) include advanced display
configuration tools that may override settings that were configured
via <span><strong class="command">nvidia-settings</strong></span>.
These tools may attempt to restore their own display configuration
when starting a new desktop session, or when events such as display
hotplugs, resolution changes, or VT switches occur.</p>
<p>These tools may also override some types of settings that are
stored in and loaded from the X configuration file, such as any
MetaMode strings that may specify the initial display layouts of
NVIDIA X screens. Although the configuration of the initial
MetaMode is static, it is possible to dynamically switch to a
different MetaMode after X has started. This can have the effect of
making the set of active displays, their resolutions, and layout
positions as configured in the <span><strong class=
"command">nvidia-settings</strong></span> control panel appear to
be ineffective, when in reality, this configuration was active when
starting X and then overridden later by the desktop
environment.</p>
<p>If you believe that your desktop environment is overriding
settings that you configured in <span><strong class=
"command">nvidia-settings</strong></span>, some possible solutions
are:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>Use the display configuration tools provided as part of the
desktop environment (e.g. <span><strong class=

<span><strong class="command">kcmshell4 display</strong></span>,
<span><strong class="command">unity-control-center

displays, instead of the <span><strong class=
"command">nvidia-settings</strong></span> control panel or the
<span><strong class="command">xrandr</strong></span> command line
tool. Setting your desired configuration using the desktop
environment's tools should cause that configuration to be the one
which is restored when the desktop environment overrides the
existing configuration from <span><strong class=
"command">nvidia-settings</strong></span>. If you are not sure
which tools your desktop environment uses for display
configuration, you may be able to discover them by navigating any
available system menus for "Display" or "Monitor" control
panels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For settings loaded from <code class=

run <span><strong class="command">nvidia-settings

from <code class="filename">~/.nvidia-settings-rc</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disable any features your desktop environment may have for
managing displays. (Note: this may disable other features, such as
display configuration tools that are integrated into the

<p>This is a special case of the issues described in <a href=
"commonproblems.html#settingsoverridden">&ldquo;The display
settings I configured in nvidia-settings do not

advanced display configuration tools will automatically configure
the display layout in response to detected configuration changes.
For example, when a new display is plugged in, such a desktop
environment may attempt to restore the previous layout that was
used with the set of currently connected displays, or may configure
a default layout based upon its own policy.</p>
<p>On X servers with support for RandR 1.2 or later, the NVIDIA X
driver reports display hotplug events to the X server via RandR
when displays are connected and disconnected. These hotplug events
may trigger a desktop environment with advanced display management
capabilities to change the display configuration. These changes may
affect settings such as the set of active displays, their
resolutions and positioning relative to each other, per-display
color correction settings, and more.</p>
<p>In addition to hotplug events generated by connecting or
disconnecting displays, DisplayPort displays will generate a hot
unplug event when they power off, and a hotplug event when they
power on, even if no physical plugging in or unplugging takes
place. This can lead to hotplug-induced display configuration
changes without any actual hotplug action taking place.</p>
<p>Upon suspend, the NVIDIA X driver will incur an implicit VT
switch. If a DisplayPort monitor is powered off when a VT switch or
modeset occurs, RandR will forget the configuration of that
monitor. As a result, the display will be left without a mode once
powered back on. In the absence of an RandR-aware window manager,
bringing back the display will require manually configuring it with
RandR.</p>
<p>If display hotplug events are resulting in undesired
configuration changes, try the solutions and workarounds listed in
<a href="commonproblems.html#settingsoverridden">&ldquo;The display
settings I configured in nvidia-settings do not

NVIDIA X driver's reporting of hotplug events with the <a href=

DisplayPort devices, which must report all hotplug events to ensure
proper functionality.</p>

<p>Nouveau is a display driver for NVIDIA GPUs, developed as an
open-source project through reverse-engineering of the NVIDIA
driver. It ships with many current Linux distributions as the
default display driver for NVIDIA hardware. It is not developed or
supported by NVIDIA, and is not related to the NVIDIA driver, other
than the fact that both Nouveau and the NVIDIA driver are capable
of driving NVIDIA GPUs. Only one driver can control a GPU at a
time, so if a GPU is being driven by the Nouveau driver, Nouveau
must be disabled before installing the NVIDIA driver.</p>
<p>Nouveau performs modesets in the kernel. This can make disabling
Nouveau difficult, as the kernel modeset is used to display a
framebuffer console, which means that Nouveau will be in use even
if X is not running. As long as Nouveau is in use, its kernel
module cannot be unloaded, which will prevent the NVIDIA kernel
module from loading. It is therefore important to make sure that
Nouveau's kernel modesetting is disabled before installing the
NVIDIA driver.</p>

modeset?</b></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="answer">
<td align="left" valign="top"></td>
<td align="left" valign="top">
<p>A simple way to prevent Nouveau from loading and performing a
kernel modeset is to add configuration directives for the module
loader to a file in one of the system's module loader configuration
directories: for example, <code class=
"filename">/etc/modprobe.d/</code> or <code class=
"filename">/usr/local/modprobe.d</code>. These configuration
directives can technically be added to any file in these
directories, but many of the existing files in these directories
are provided and maintained by your distributor, which may from
time to time provide updated configuration files which could
conflict with your changes. Therefore, it is recommended to create
a new file, for example, <code class=
"filename">/etc/modprobe.d/disable-nouveau.conf</code>, rather than
editing one of the existing files, such as the popular <code class=
"filename">/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf</code>. Note that some
module loaders will only look for configuration directives in files
whose names end with <code class="filename">.conf</code>, so if you
are creating a new file, make sure its name ends with <code class=
"filename">.conf</code>.</p>
<p>Whether you choose to create a new file or edit an existing one,
the following two lines will need to be added:</p>
<pre class="screen">
blacklist nouveau
options nouveau modeset=0
</pre>
<p>The first line will prevent Nouveau's kernel module from loading
automatically at boot. It will not prevent manual loading of the
module, and it will not prevent the X server from loading the
kernel module; see "How do I prevent the X server from loading
Nouveau?" below. The second line will prevent Nouveau from doing a
kernel modeset. Without the kernel modeset, it is possible to
unload Nouveau's kernel module, in the event that it is
accidentally or intentionally loaded.</p>
<p>You will need to reboot your system after adding these
configuration directives in order for them to take effect.</p>
<p>If nvidia-installer detects Nouveau is in use by the system, it
will offer to create such a modprobe configuration file to disable
Nouveau.</p>

<td align="left" valign="top">
<p>Some distributions include Nouveau in an initial ramdisk image
(henceforth referred to as "initrd" in this document, and sometimes
also known as "initramfs"), so that Nouveau's kernel modeset can
take place as early as possible in the boot process. This poses an
additional challenge to those who wish to prevent the modeset from
occurring, as the modeset will occur while the system is executing
within the initrd, before any directives in the module loader
configuration files are processed.</p>
<p>If you have an initrd which loads the Nouveau driver, you will
additionally need to ensure that Nouveau is disabled in the initrd.
In most cases, rebuilding the initrd will pick up the module loader
configuration files, including any which may disable Nouveau.
Please consult your distribution's documentation on how to rebuild
the initrd, as different distributions have different tools for
building and modifying the initrd. Some popular distro initrd tools
include: <code class="filename">dracut</code>, <code class=
"filename">mkinitrd</code>, and <code class=
"filename">update-initramfs</code>.</p>
<p>Some initrds understand the <code class=
"option">rdblacklist</code> parameter. On these initrds, as an
alternative to rebuilding the initrd, you can add the option
<code class="option">rdblacklist=nouveau</code> to your kernel's
boot parameters. On initrds that do not support <code class=
"option">rdblacklist</code>, it is possible to prevent Nouveau from
performing a kernel modeset by adding the option <code class=
"option">nouveau.modeset=0</code> to your kernel's boot parameters.
Note that <code class="option">nouveau.modeset=0</code> will
prevent a kernel modeset, but it may not prevent Nouveau from being
loaded, so rebuilding the initrd or using <code class=
"option">rdblacklist</code> may be more effective than using
<code class="option">nouveau.modeset=0</code>.</p>
<p>Any changes to the default kernel boot parameters should be made
in your bootloader's configuration file(s), so that the options get
passed to your kernel every time the system is booted. Please
consult your distribution's documentation on how to configure your
bootloader, as different distributions use different bootloaders
and configuration files.</p>

<p>Blacklisting Nouveau will only prevent it from being loaded
automatically at boot. If an X server is started as part of the
normal boot process, and that X server uses the Nouveau X driver,
then the Nouveau kernel module will still be loaded. Should this
happen, you will be able to unload Nouveau with `modprobe -r
nouveau` after stopping the X server, as long as you have taken
care to prevent it from doing a kernel modeset; however, it is
probably better to just make sure that X does not load Nouveau in
the first place.</p>
<p>If your system is not configured to start an X server at boot,
then you can simply run the NVIDIA driver installer after
rebooting. Otherwise, the easiest thing to do is to edit your X
server's configuration file so that your X server uses a
non-modesetting driver that is compatible with your card, such as
the <code class="systemitem">vesa</code> driver. You can then stop
X and install the driver as usual. Please consult your X server's
documentation to determine where your X server configuration file
is located.</p>
