<p><b>How and when are the NVIDIA device files created?</b></p>
</td>

<tr class="answer">
<td align="left" valign="top"></td>
<td align="left" valign="top">
<p>When a user-space NVIDIA driver component needs to communicate
with the NVIDIA kernel module, and the NVIDIA character device
files do not yet exist, the user-space component will first attempt
to load the kernel module and create the device files itself.</p>
<p>Device file creation and kernel module loading generally require
root privileges. The X driver, running within a setuid root X
server, will have these privileges, but not, e.g., the CUDA driver
within the environment of a normal user.</p>
<p>If the user-space NVIDIA driver component cannot load the kernel
module or create the device files itself, it will attempt to invoke
the setuid root nvidia-modprobe utility, which will perform these
operations on behalf of the non-privileged driver.</p>
<p>See the nvidia-modprobe(1) man page, or its source code,
available here: <a href=
"https://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/nvidia-modprobe/" target=
"_top">https://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/nvidia-modprobe/</a></p>
<p>When possible, it is recommended to use your Linux
distribution's native mechanisms for managing kernel module loading
and device file creation. nvidia-modprobe is provided as a fallback
to work out-of-the-box in a distribution-independent way.</p>
<p>Whether a user-space NVIDIA driver component does so itself, or
invokes nvidia-modprobe, it will default to creating the device
files with the following attributes:</p>
<pre class="screen">
      UID:  0     - 'root'
      GID:  0     - 'root'
      Mode: 0666  - 'rw-rw-rw-'
</pre>
<p>Existing device files are changed if their attributes don't
match these defaults. If you want the NVIDIA driver to create the
device files with different attributes, you can specify them with
the "NVreg_DeviceFileUID" (user), "NVreg_DeviceFileGID" (group) and
"NVreg_DeviceFileMode" NVIDIA Linux kernel module parameters.</p>
<p>For example, the NVIDIA driver can be instructed to create
device files with UID=0 (root), GID=44 (video) and Mode=0660 by
passing the following module parameters to the NVIDIA Linux kernel
module:</p>
<pre class="screen">
      NVreg_DeviceFileUID=0
      NVreg_DeviceFileGID=44
      NVreg_DeviceFileMode=0660
</pre>
<p>The "NVreg_ModifyDeviceFiles" NVIDIA kernel module parameter
will disable dynamic device file management, if set to 0.</p>

<p>Not every Linux distribution uses RPM, and NVIDIA provides a
single solution that works across all Linux distributions. NVIDIA
encourages Linux distributions to repackage and redistribute the
NVIDIA Linux driver in their native package management formats.
These repackaged NVIDIA drivers are likely to inter-operate best
with the Linux distribution's package management technology. For

<p>By default, the NVIDIA X driver prints relatively few messages
to stderr and the X log file. If you need to troubleshoot, then it
may be helpful to enable more verbose output by using the X command
line options <code class="option">-verbose</code> and <code class=
"option">-logverbose</code>, which can be used to set the verbosity
level for the <code class="filename">stderr</code> and log file
messages, respectively. The NVIDIA X driver will output more
messages when the verbosity level is at or above 5 (X defaults to
verbosity level 1 for <code class="filename">stderr</code> and
level 3 for the log file). So, to enable verbose messaging from the
NVIDIA X driver to both the log file and <code class=
"filename">stderr</code>, you could start X with the verbosity
level set to 5, by doing the following</p>

probably need to install it. If the versions listed mismatch (e.g.,
kernel-2.6.15-7 vs. kernel-devel-2.6.15-10), then you will need to
update the kernel-devel package to match the installed kernel. If
you have multiple kernels installed, you need to install the

<tr class="answer">
<td align="left" valign="top"></td>
<td align="left" valign="top">
<p>When measuring any application's memory usage, you must be
careful to distinguish between physical system RAM used and virtual
mappings of shared resources. For example, most shared libraries
exist only once in physical memory but are mapped into multiple
processes. This memory should only be counted once when computing
total memory usage. In the same way, the video memory on a graphics
card or register memory on any device can be mapped into multiple
processes. These mappings do not consume normal system RAM.</p>
<p>This has been a frequently discussed topic on XFree86 mailing
lists; see, for example:</p>
<p><a href=
"http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=xfree-xpert&amp;m=96835767116567&amp;w=2"
target=

<p>The <span><strong class="command">pmap</strong></span> utility
described in the above thread is available in the "procps" package
shipped with most recent Linux distributions, and is a useful tool
in distinguishing between types of memory mappings. For example,
while <span><strong class="command">top</strong></span> may
indicate that X is using several hundred MB of memory, the last
line of output from the output of pmap (note that pmap may need to
be run as root):</p>
<pre class="screen">
    # pmap -d `pidof X` | tail -n 1
    mapped: 161404K    writeable/private: 7260K    shared: 118056K
</pre>
<p>reveals that X is really only using roughly 7MB of system RAM
(the "writeable/private" value).</p>
<p>Note, also, that X must allocate resources on behalf of X
clients (the window manager, your web browser, etc); the X server's
memory usage will increase as more clients request resources such
as pixmaps, and decrease as you close X applications.</p>

<p>The NVIDIA driver does not support the graphics component of the
XFree86-DGA (Direct Graphics Access) extension. Applications can
use the XDGASelectInput() function to acquire relative pointer
motion, but graphics-related functions such as XDGASetMode() and
XDGAOpenFramebuffer() will fail.</p>
<p>The graphics component of XFree86-DGA is not supported because
it requires a CPU mapping of framebuffer memory. As graphics cards
ship with increasing quantities of video memory, the NVIDIA X
driver has had to switch to a more dynamic memory mapping scheme
that is incompatible with DGA. Furthermore, DGA does not cooperate
with other graphics rendering libraries such as Xlib and OpenGL
because it accesses GPU resources directly.</p>
<p>NVIDIA recommends that applications use OpenGL or Xlib, rather
than DGA, for graphics rendering. Using rendering libraries other
than DGA will yield better performance and improve interoperability
with other X applications.</p>

<pre class="screen">
"%d@%d:%d:%d", bus, domain, device, function
</pre>
<p>in printf(3) syntax. NVIDIA X driver logging, nvidia-xconfig,
and nvidia-settings match the X configuration file BusID
convention.</p>
<p>The lspci(8) utility, in contrast, reports the PCI BusID of a
PCI device in the format "domain:bus:device.function", printing the
values in hexadecimal. More specifically,</p>
<pre class="screen">
"%04x:%02x:%02x.%x", domain, bus, device, function
</pre>
<p>in printf(3) syntax. The "Bus Location" reported in the
information file matches the lspci format. Also, the name of
per-GPU directory in /proc/driver/nvidia/gpus is the same as the
corresponding GPU's PCI BusID in lspci format.</p>
<p>On systems where both an integrated GPU and a PCI slot are
present, setting the "BusID" option to "AXI" selects the integrated
GPU. By default, not specifying this option or setting it to an
empty string selects a discrete GPU if available, the integrated
GPU otherwise.</p>

<p><b>How do I interpret X server version numbers?</b></p>

<td align="left" valign="top">
<p>X server version numbers can be difficult to interpret because
some X.Org X servers report the versions of different things.</p>
<p>In 2003, X.Org created a fork of the XFree86 project's code
base, which used a monolithic build system to build the X server,
libraries, and applications together in one source code repository.
It resumed the release version numbering where it left off in 2001,
continuing with 6.7, 6.8, etc., for the releases of this large
bundle of code. These version numbers are sometimes written
X11R6.7, X11R6.8, etc. to include the version of the X
protocol.</p>
<p>In 2005, an effort was made to split the monolithic code base
into separate modules with their own version numbers to make them
easier to maintain and so that they could be released
independently. X.Org still occasionally releases these modules
together, with a single version number. These releases are simply
referred to as &ldquo;<span class="quote">X.Org
releases</span>&rdquo;, or sometimes &ldquo;<span class=
"quote">katamari</span>&rdquo; releases. For example, X.Org 7.6 was
released on December 20, 2010 and contains version 1.9.3 of the
xorg-server package, which contains the core X server itself.</p>
<p>The release management changes from XFree86, to X.Org monolithic
releases, to X.Org modular releases impacted the behavior of the X
server's <code class="computeroutput">-version</code> command line
option. For example, XFree86 X servers always report the version of
the XFree86 monolithic package:</p>
<pre class="screen">
XFree86 Version 4.3.0 (Red Hat Linux release: 4.3.0-2)
Release Date: 27 February 2003
X Protocol Version 11, Revision 0, Release 6.6
</pre>
<p>X servers in X.Org monolithic and early &ldquo;<span class=
"quote">katamari</span>&rdquo; releases did something similar:</p>
<pre class="screen">
X Window System Version 7.1.1
Release Date: 12 May 2006
X Protocol Version 11, Revision 0, Release 7.1.1
</pre>
<p>However, X.Org later modified the X server to start printing its
individual module version number instead:</p>
<pre class="screen">
X.Org X Server 1.9.3
Release Date: 2010-12-13
X Protocol Version 11, Revision 0
</pre>
<p>Please keep this in mind when comparing X server versions: what
looks like &ldquo;<span class="quote">version 7.x</span>&rdquo; is
<span class="emphasis"><em>older</em></span> than version 1.x.</p>

<p><b>Why doesn't the NVIDIA X driver make more display resolutions
and refresh rates available via RandR?</b></p>

<td align="left" valign="top">
<p>Prior to the 302.* driver series, the list of modes reported to
applications by the NVIDIA X driver was not limited to the list of
modes natively supported by a display device. In order to expose
the largest possible set of modes on digital flat panel displays,
which typically do not accept arbitrary mode timings, the driver
maintained separate sets of "front-end" and "back-end" mode
timings, and scaled between them to simulate the availability of
more modes than would otherwise be supported.</p>
<p>Front-end timings were the values reported to applications, and
back-end timings were what was actually sent to the display. Both
sets of timings went through the full mode validation process, with
the back-end timings having the additional constraint that they
must be provided by the display's EDID, as only EDID-provided modes
can be safely assumed to be supported by the display hardware.
Applications could request any available front-end timings, which
the driver would implicitly scale to either the "best fit" or
"native" mode timings. For example, an application might request an
800x600 @ 60 Hz mode and the driver would provide it, but the real
mode sent to the display would be 1920x1080 @ 30 Hz. While the
availability of modes beyond those natively supported by a display
was convenient for some uses, it created several problems. For
example:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>The complete front-end timings were reported to applications,
but only the width and height were actually used. This could cause
confusion because in many cases, changing the front-end timings did
not change the back-end timings. This was especially confusing when
trying to change the refresh rate, because the refresh rate in the
front-end timings was ignored, but was still reported to
applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The front-end timings reported to the user could be different
from the backend timings reported in the display device's on screen
display, leading to user confusion. Finding out the back-end
timings (e.g. to find the real refresh rate) required using the
NVIDIA-specific NV-CONTROL X extension.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The process by which back-end timings were selected for use with
any given front-end timings was not transparent to users, and this
process could only be explicitly configured with NVIDIA-specific
xorg.conf options or the NV-CONTROL X extension. Confusion over how
changing front-end timings could affect the back-end timings was
especially problematic in use cases that were sensitive to the
timings the display device receives, such as NVIDIA 3D Vision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User-specified modes underwent normal mode validation, even
though the timings in those modes were not used. For example, a
1920x1080 @ 100 Hz mode might fail the VertRefresh check, even
though the back-end timings might actually be 1920x1080 @ 30
Hz.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>Version 1.2 of the X Resize and Rotate extension (henceforth
referred to as "RandR 1.2") allows configuration of display scaling
in a much more flexible and standardized way. The protocol allows
applications to choose exactly which (back-end) mode timing is
used, and exactly how the screen is scaled to fill that mode. It
also allows explicit control over which displays are enabled, and
which portions of the screen they display. This also provides
much-needed transparency: the mode timings reported by RandR 1.2
are the actual mode timings being sent to the display. However,
this means that only modes actually supported by the display are
reported in the RandR 1.2 mode list. Scaling configurations, such
as the 800x600 to 1920x1080 example above, need to be configured
via the RandR 1.2 transform feature. Adding implicitly scaled modes
to the mode list would conflict with the transform configuration
options and reintroduce the same problems that the previous
front-end/back-end timing system had.</p>
<p>With the introduction of RandR 1.2 support to the 302.* driver
series, the front-end/back-end timing system was abandoned, and the
list of mode timings exposed by the NVIDIA X driver was simplified
to include only those modes which would actually be driven by the
hardware. Although it remained possible to manually configure all
of the scaling configurations that were previously possible, and
many scaling configurations which were previously impossible, this
change resulted in some inconvenient losses of functionality:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>Applications which used RandR 1.1 or earlier or XF86VidMode to
set modes no longer had the implicitly scaled front-end timings
available to them. Many displays have EDIDs which advertise only
the display's native resolution, or a list of resolutions that is
otherwise small, compared to the list that would previously have
been exposed as front-end timings, preventing these applications
from setting modes that were possible with previous versions of the
NVIDIA driver.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <span><strong class=
"command">nvidia-settings</strong></span> control panel, which
formerly listed all available front-end modes for displays in its X
Server Display Configuration page, only listed the actual back-end
modes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>Subsequent driver releases restored some of this functionality
without reverting to the front-end/back-end system:</p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">
<li>
<p>The NVIDIA X driver now builds a list of "Implicit MetaModes",
which implicitly scale many common resolutions to a mode that is
supported by the display. These modes are exposed to applications
which use RandR 1.1 and XF86VidMode, as neither supports the
scaling or other transform capabilities of RandR 1.2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The resolution list in the <span><strong class=
"command">nvidia-settings</strong></span> X Server Display
Configuration page now includes explicitly scaled modes for many
common resolutions which are not directly supported by the display.
To reduce confusion, the scaled modes are identified as being
scaled, and it is not possible to set a refresh rate for any of the
scaled modes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>As mentioned previously, the RandR 1.2 mode list contains only
modes which are supported by the display. Modern applications that
wish to set modes other than those available in the RandR 1.2 mode
list are encouraged to use RandR 1.2 transformations to program any
required scaling operations. For example, the <span><strong class=
"command">xrandr</strong></span> utility can program RandR scaling
transformations, and the following command can scale a 1280x720
mode to a display connected to output DVI-I-0 that does not support
the desired mode, but does support 1920x1080:</p>
<pre class="screen">
xrandr --output DVI-I-0 --mode 1920x1080 --scale-from 1280x720
