<p>A Linux daemon utility, <span><strong class=
"command">nvidia-persistenced</strong></span>, addresses an
undesirable side effect of the NVIDIA kernel driver behavior in
certain computing environments. Whenever the NVIDIA device
resources are no longer in use, the NVIDIA kernel driver will tear
down the device state. Normally, this is the intended behavior of
the device driver, but for some applications, the latencies
incurred by repetitive device initialization can significantly
impact performance.</p>
<p>To avoid this behavior, <span><strong class=
"command">nvidia-persistenced</strong></span> provides a
configuration option called "persistence mode" that can be set by
NVIDIA management software, such as <span><strong class=
"command">nvidia-smi</strong></span>. When persistence mode is
enabled, the daemon holds the NVIDIA character device files open,
preventing the NVIDIA kernel driver from tearing down device state
when no other process is using the device. This utility does not
actually use any device resources itself - it will simply sleep
while maintaining a reference to the NVIDIA device state.</p>

<p><span><strong class=
"command">nvidia-persistenced</strong></span> is included with the
NVIDIA Linux GPU driver. After installing the driver, this utility
may be installed to run on system startup or manually with the
command:</p>
<pre class="screen">
    # nvidia-persistenced
</pre>
<p>in a terminal window. Note that the daemon may require root
privileges to create its runtime data directory,
/var/run/nvidia-persistenced/, or it may otherwise need to be run
as a user that has access to that directory.</p>
<p>Detailed help and usage information is available primarily via
the <span><strong class=
"command">nvidia-persistenced</strong></span> man page, as well as
the <span><strong class="command">--help</strong></span> command
line option.</p>
<p>The source code to nvidia-persistenced is released under the MIT
license and is available at: <a href=
"https://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/nvidia-persistenced/" target=
"_top">https://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/nvidia-persistenced/</a>.</p>

<p>If you have difficulty getting <span><strong class=
"command">nvidia-persistenced</strong></span> to work as expected,
the best way to gather information as to what is happening is to
run the daemon with the <span><strong class=
"command">--verbose</strong></span> option.</p>
<p><span><strong class=
"command">nvidia-persistenced</strong></span> detaches from its
parent process very early on, and as such only invalid command line
argument errors will be printed in the terminal window. All other
output, including verbose informational messages, are sent to the
syslog interface instead. Consult your distribution's documentation
for accessing syslog output.</p>

<p>The daemon utility <span><strong class=
"command">nvidia-persistenced</strong></span> is installed by the
NVIDIA Linux GPU driver installer, but it is not installed to run
on system startup. Due to the wide variety of init systems used by
the various Linux distributions that the NVIDIA Linux GPU driver
supports, we request that package maintainers for those
distributions provide the packaging necessary to integrate well
with their platform.</p>
<p>NVIDIA provides sample init scripts for some common init systems
in
/usr/share/doc/NVIDIA_GLX-1.0/sample/nvidia-persistenced-init.tar.bz2
to aid in installation of the utility.</p>
<p><span><strong class=
"command">nvidia-persistenced</strong></span> is intended to be run
as a daemon from system initialization, and is generally designed
as a tool for compute-only platforms where the NVIDIA device is not
used to display a graphical user interface. As such, depending on
how your package is typically used, it may not be necessary to
install the daemon to run on system initialization.</p>
<p>If <span><strong class=
"command">nvidia-persistenced</strong></span> is packaged to run on
system initialization, the package installation, init script or
system management utility that runs the daemon should provide the
following:</p>
<div class="variablelist">
<dl>
<dt><span class="term">A non-root user to run as</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>It is strongly recommended, though not required, that the daemon
be run as a non-root user for security purposes.</p>
<p>The daemon may either be started with root privileges and the
<span><strong class="command">--user</strong></span> option, or it
may be run directly as the non-root user.</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="term">Runtime access to
/var/run/nvidia-persistenced/</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>The daemon must be able to create its socket and PID file in
this directory.</p>
<p>If the daemon is run as root, it will create this directory
itself and remove it when it shuts down cleanly.</p>
<p>If the daemon is run as a non-root user, this directory must
already exist, and the daemon will not attempt to remove it when it
shuts down cleanly.</p>
<p>If the daemon is started as root, but provided a non-root user
to run as via the <span><strong class=
"command">--user</strong></span> option, the daemon will create
this directory itself, <span><strong class=
"command">chown</strong></span> it to the provided user, and
<span><strong class="command">setuid</strong></span> to the
provided user to drop root privileges. The daemon may be unable to
remove this directory when it shuts down cleanly, depending on the
privileges of the provided user.</p>
